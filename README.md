# instagram_clone_databse_project

## Project Description:

 This project involves designing a database for an Instagram clone with 7 tables: users, likes, follows, photos, comments, photo_tags, and tags. The database will store all the relevant data required to mimic the functionality of Instagram. The following is a brief description of each table:

Table 1: **Users** This table will store information about registered users. It will include fields such as id, username, and created_at.

Table 2: **Likes** This table will store information about likes for photos. It will include fields such as user_id, photo_id, and created_at.

Table 3: **Follows** This table will store information about user followings. It will include fields such as follower_id, followee_id, and created_at.

Table 4: **Photos** This table will store information about uploaded photos. It will include fields such as id, user_id, image_url, and created_at.

Table 5: **Comments** This table will store information about comments on photos. It will include fields such as id, user_id, photo_id, comment_text, and created_at.

Table 6: **Photo_tags** This table will store information about tags associated with photos. It will include fields such as tag_id and photo_id.

Table 7: **Tags** This table will store information about all tags used in the application. It will include fields such as id, tag_name, and created_at.

## Task Performed:

1.  **Database design:** This involves designing the database schema and creating tables to store user data, such as Users, Photos, Comments, Likes, Follows, Tags, and Photo_tags.
    
2.  **Database modeling:** This involves defining the relationships between the tables and creating constraints to ensure data integrity.
    
3.  **Filtering and querying:** This involves running SQL queries to filter and analyze the data in the tables. For example, you can find the oldest users by sorting the Users table by date of birth, or find users who have never posted a photo by joining the Users and Photos tables and selecting users who do not have any associated photos.
    
4.  **Ranking users:** This involves counting the number of photos associated with each user in the Photos table and sorting in descending order to rank users by their posting activity.
    
5.  **Identifying trends:** This involves analyzing data to identify trends in user behavior, such as the day of the week most users register on, or the top 5 most commonly used hashtags.
    
6.  **Summarizing insights:** This involves summarizing the insights gained from the analysis into a format that is easy to understand and use for decision-making. For example, you can determine the percentage of users who have either never commented on a photo or have commented on every photo to gain insights into user engagement and activity on the platform.
    

## Conclusion:

The  project involved designing and modeling a database to store user data, and performing various data analysis tasks such as filtering and querying, ranking users, identifying trends, and summarizing insights. The project provided valuable insights into user behavior and trends, which can be used to optimize the platform and improve the user experience. By leveraging the power of SQL, the project demonstrated how data analysis can help gain valuable insights into user behavior and trends, and how these insights can be used to inform decision-making and drive business growth. Overall, the Instagram clone project is a great example of how data analysis can be applied to real-world scenarios to drive business value and improve the user experience.
